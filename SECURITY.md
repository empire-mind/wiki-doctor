## Status

This project is **pre-v1**: no tagged release exists yet. The supported
version is `main` (see the table below).

## Supported versions

| Version         | Supported with security updates |

Security fixes land on `main`. Once versioned releases exist, the latest
release will also receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.**

Use GitHub's **private vulnerability reporting**: on this repository's page,
open the **Security** tab and choose **"Report a vulnerability"**. Your
report stays visible only to you and the maintainers until a fix is ready
and a public advisory is published.

What to include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (the exact \`wiki-doctor.py\` invocation and a minimal
  wiki fixture)
- The potential impact
- A suggested fix, if you have one

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Vulnerabilities in \`wiki-doctor.py\`, the linter checks, and the forkable
  \`template/\` on this repository's default branch — in particular,
  anything that would let a crafted wiki file execute code, exfiltrate data,
  or write outside the scanned directory
- Supply-chain issues in declared dependencies (see the Dependabot note
  below)
- Misconfigurations in this repository's CI workflows

**Out of scope:**

- Theoretical issues without a plausible exploit path
- Findings in forked copies or stale branches
- Social engineering or physical attacks
- Linter blind spots already documented as honest limits in the README —
  file those as ordinary issues so the lint-rule roadmap improves

## Response expectations

We will acknowledge your report within **7 calendar days**. For confirmed
issues we will share a remediation plan or timeline within **14 days** of
acknowledgement. We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly
until a fix is available.

## Secret scanning and Dependabot
